Fifty mosquito repellent products, including mosquito repellent patches and wristbands, prove to be of little help, said Beijing quality supervision authorities after conducting sample tests recently.
Bought from online and offline stores, these new mosquito repellent products, with price tags varying from 5.2 to 66 yuan, all boasted a plant-based formula with a long effective duration for babies and pregnant women.
The result is obvious and disappointing. These products, regardless of a touted period of effectiveness ranging from five hours to 60 days, did very little in preventing mosquitoes.
Scientists noted that the dose of citronellol, an oil used for keeping insects away, in mosquito repellent products is the key factor in assessing its effectiveness.
Among the 50 samples, 14 of them did not have citronellol, while the rest reportedly had the ingredient but at amounts below the standard.
Those repellent patches and wristbands that claim to ward off mosquitoes are not friendly to babies and pregnant women, a group that these products target.
Researchers said the so-called plant-based and non-toxic products on the market have yet to undergo scientific testing, which is why vulnerable groups are not advised to use such repellents.
